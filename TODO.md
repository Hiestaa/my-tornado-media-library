## bugs

* When creating a new tag by changing the value of a tag attached to a video to a value that doesn't exist, two tags end up being created. One for the specified value, and what for the specified value capitalized.

## Short term

* "Smoothing" function, like a moving average in the post-processing step

## Long term

* Make a bulk analysis page (similar to db update process)
* filter album by tags and properties, random should only use those tags
* albums playlist
* sorting order for albums (including 'random')
